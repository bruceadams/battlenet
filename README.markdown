battlenet
=========

Clojure library for Blizzard's Community Platform API

Infos
---------
This is far from stable and just some remotely useful project while trying 
to dig into Clojure. It's probably ugly or even just plain wrong.

Shouts
------
* Loosely based on [battlenet-python](https://github.com/vishnevskiy/battlenet)
* [This](http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html) and [this](http://www.moxleystratton.com/article/clojure/for-non-lisp-programmers) helped me a lot
